# 10X We Learn

Yesterday (09/04/2022) I am so thrilled to join 7 ground-breakers & future-makers to jump start the 1st ever **10X We Learn** party !

There has been tons of "Hahaa" & "Aha" moments for me (: 

Here is what exciting us...

Who are we?
=====================================
- Laura Wells CEO & Founder of Awake Teams

- Jinwoo Kim, pioneer researcher of Graph ML from S.Korea

- Hakim Elakhrass, co-founder of NannyML

- Louis Korczowski ðŸ¤“, co-founder of siopi.ai

- Chris Allen, co-founder of grantwiser.com

- Tivo Rojas-Cheatham, MPH, principal strategist & performance coach

- Paul Jialiang Wu (me:), co-founder of Humors.live

Image with me for a moment, see 10X We Learn as 

"A friend-ship of SEERs (Scientists Engineers Entrepreneurs aRtists) sailing through the Knowledge Sea, looking into Heavenly Places for all possible exponential growing curves, bringing back 10X long-term return by daily investing significant amount of attention in self-study and accountability-exchange, all happen within 12 weeks."

Why 10X We Learn
=====================================
- Instead of watching afar, we learn directly from some game changers, by talking and walking with them for 12 weeks for fast & frequent feedback

- Instead of being superficial, we build lasting & meaningful friendship while each is building up oneself

- Instead of shooting squirrel, we are going after Goliath: we pursue a future big & exciting enough to pull our current-self forward.

- Instead of being reactive or random, we systematically upgrade our feeling, thinking, speaking and executing by data backed sciences

What make **10X We Learn** stand-out?
=====================================

- "Whatever I commit to will come true" You are 100% designer & driver of your future; you are the role model of the rest 100% of the time. We train one another to **speak things into being** with full autonomy.

- "We hold you accountable to whatever you promise yourself to do"

Instead of letting go the sloppy-old-you, we give one another invitation to chase down the chains of reasoning and the traps of emotion that stop you or slow you down onto the 10X Future-You.

- Dream Directed + Data Driven: 

we simply learn the future & make the history, not other way along as 99.9% majority do. 
We start from the BIG & EXCITING ends, then we reverse engineer: collecting more relevant data, understanding deeper logics, and adapting better strategies and executing more rewarding actions.

- We do human-to-human transfer-learning: instead of going through everything by ourselves through years long trials and errors, we receive inspirations, insights and advises from accomplished achievers and go directly from 0 to 10 within weeks, figuring out any possible exponential growing curves.

What is happening?
==================

- At least once a week we have a 1-hour long party to celebrate one another's weekly achievement & dive deep into any possible space for 10X growth. 

- During the week each of us have our own meeting space to invest in each's longterm-principal objectives, with door open to other 10X participants for virtual coffee, fast walk & deep talk.

Then, what about me...?
=======================

Are you really prompted? 

1. Give this repo a **STAR**. Thank you!
2. Contact [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-jialiang-wu-67aa7179/). 

Are you still in doubt?

1. Explain why
2. Forward it to someone "hungry" enough to pursue it.



This repo uses the following temperate:
## nbdev_colab

### Why
- to develop your package, to test code, to write documentation from 1 source of truth: your colab notebooks
- no beefy local computer needed, everything is computed with a colab notebook and stored on your Google drive

### How

Step0: clone this template to your github account.

Step1: create a new repo (e.g. name it 'my_amazing_project') using this template. 

Step2: to clone your newly created repo in your Google drive, use colab to open this notebook [git_clone_my_amazing_project_to_gdrive.ipynb](https://github.com/wjlgatech/nbdev_colab/blob/master/git_clone_my_amazing_project_to_gdrive.ipynb) and run it through.

Step3: to learn what to do next, start at notebook `nb/00_core.ipynb` from your Google Drive


Known bugs that need to be sorted (any help is welcome):

* ReadMe not updating after updating `index.ipynb`
* Tests are not passing
