### top4 quadrants
1. attend Graph DS meeting by Arango
- connect & collaborate the leaders in both academics & industrial
- review main tech-stack (gDB, gML) and applications (eg. molecular dynamics & drug discovery, recommenders, knowledge map …)
- interview with vendors, learner and producer

2. study gML
- make this TRUE [‘permutation symmetries’, ‘graph isomorphism’, ‘gnn powers’, ‘graph laplacian’]
- make YouTube video + colab notebook on those 4 subjects
- read associated seminal paper & ppt

3. interview potential users
- internal: ch..., br..., li..., ni...
- external: rd...,

4. calpal data
- 03/2022 - 07/2022 as training set while 07/2022 - 10/2022 data as test set

### Routines to grow
- morning routine: 2 hr gML learning => 1hr walk & talk =>3x 2hr coding
- night routine: 0.5-1.5 hr training => write blogs 3 nights & read books 3 nights 0.5-1.5 hr
- random videos & podcast: during dinner, driving & training

## Purpose: What do the Results look like?

- G: gML: {"input": 24 block x 15 min/block = 360 min, "output": ['permutation symmetries', 'graph isomorphism', 'gnn powers', 'graph laplacian']}

- Y: YouTube & YouVersion: {'input': 'daily LIVE broadcast & journaling on "AI-ML-DS make all sense in LOVE!" ', 'output':['meet 5 future makers in SF Bay']}

- M: MMA-Marathon-Mountaineer: {'input':['daily run to neighborhoods including Stanford Court, Golden Gate bridge', 'visit 3 national parks']'output':['measure time & distance toward & back', 'talk & walk with the LORD to his kids']}


## Design

What are the key players (people, processes, products, protocols, design & operational principles) in the game?

## Feedback & feedforward

How are the main players are connected & collaborate? What are the key signals to look forward & fetch back?

## Streams of FIRE

What are the Friendship, Inspiration, Reflection, Entrepreneurship (eg. love, joy, peace, faith, hope) flowing in & out, circulating between me and X (eg. GraphML, YouTube, MMA-Marathon-Mountaineer,my wife, my kids, my colleages, my clients, my training partners)
